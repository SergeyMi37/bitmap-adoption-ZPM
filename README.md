This is a running example of the article in DC on [Bitmap Adoption](https://community.intersystems.com/post/adopted-bitmap)   

The full background story is found there.  

The base class Bmap.Person defines persons within an organization distributed  
by various countries. All records are indexed by (Country, PersonalId).  
this structure doesn't allow use of bitmaps.  

So a wrapper class Bmap.PersonQ around the data eliminates the top level of  
the index (Country) and isolates the PersonalId (%Integer, MINVAL=1).  
We are ready to use a Bitmap index.  

A few performance figures on 300010 generated records.  
You see that Relative Cost are sometimes quite misleading.
